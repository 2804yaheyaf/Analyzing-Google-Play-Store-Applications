# Analyzing-Google-Play-Store-Applications
Through this project, I am trying to visualize and analyze the different kinds of applications availible on play store and understand what actually increases an application’s possibility to garner more number of downloads. The data I have chosen is a dataset of all applications available on the Google Play Store as of January 1st, 2018. The dataset was taken from google’s official website, ie, support.google.com The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market! It is a web scraped data of over 10,000+ play store apps for analysing the andorid market
